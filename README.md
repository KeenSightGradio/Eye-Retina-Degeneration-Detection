# Eye Retina Degeneration Detection App

This is an application built using Python to detect degeneration in eye retinas. It utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to predict whether an input image shows signs of diabetic retinopathy or not.

## Installation

To run the application, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through a web interface. The interface allows you to perform two main actions: train your own model and detect degeneration in eye retinas.

### Train Your Own Model

1. On the web interface, navigate to the "Model Training" section.
2. Adjust the number of epochs using the slider to specify the desired number of training iterations.
3. Click the "Train Model" button to start the training process.
4. The accuracy score of the trained model will be displayed in the "Accuracy Score" textbox.

### Detect Degeneration

1. In the "Please upload an image to detect degeneration!" section, click the "Choose File" button.
2. Select an image from your local machine that you want to analyze for degeneration.
3. Click the "Detect" button to initiate the prediction process.
4. The predicted class (either "Diabetic Retinopathy" or "No Diabetic Retinopathy") and the probabilities of each class will be displayed in the corresponding fields.
